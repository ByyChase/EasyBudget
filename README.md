# EasyBudget- This program is currently working with some small bugs 
It is a side project I am working on to keep my programming skills up while I do not have a 
programming class. Currently there are known bugs and missing features 
that are being worked on. Version 1.1 is to be released by the end of June 
which we plan on finishing all features currently in the program as well 
as adding the ability to work with money in your bank accounts currently. 
A user friendly GUI is planned on being added by the end of July
